# LabVIEW Programming Fundamentals

![](../../../../docs/cover/basic.png)

This chapter provides an introduction to the fundamental aspects of LabVIEW programming. It covers the most frequently used data types, controls, structures, subVIs, functions and their applications within LabVIEW.

In LabVIEW, controls serve as the primary means to input and display data. LabVIEW supports a wide range of data types. Common data types such as numeric values, Booleans, and arrays are shared with other programming languages. However, LabVIEW also includes unique data types specific to its environment, like waveforms and instrument logic names. The relationship between controls and data types in LabVIEW can be intricate. Generally, a single data type may correspond to multiple controls, and some controls are versatile enough to represent various data types.

SubVIs in LabVIEW function similarly to functions in textual programming languages. They act as basic modular units for data manipulation within a program. Structures, on the other hand, are utilized to control the execution sequence of a program, altering the flow of operations based on specific conditions or loops. These structures in LabVIEW parallel the use of structures and control statements in traditional programming languages.
